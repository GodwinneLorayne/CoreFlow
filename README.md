The future of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) systems

## Elevator Pitch

Introducing CoreFlow, the future of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) systems designed to revolutionize your software development lifecycle. CoreFlow offers unparalleled performance by capitalizing on server scaling and leveraging multiple CPU cores, ensuring your builds and deployments are swift, efficient, and responsive. It prioritizes reliability, enabling you to define job dependencies based on data, rather than direct job associations, effectively eliminating the risk of build failures due to missed dependencies. CoreFlow brings forth a new dimension in job orchestration with its fork-join parallelism, speeding up your pipeline by executing independent tasks simultaneously. Its extensible design supports aggregation of job dependency chains, providing a streamlined view of results and logs for rapid diagnosis and optimization. With CoreFlow, you experience CI/CD as it should be - reliable, fast, and flexible.
