Absolutely, here's a comprehensive summary of CoreFlow:

CoreFlow is a robust and extensible CI/CD system designed with an emphasis on reliability, performance, and extensibility. Its salient features include:

The ability to scale server performance effectively across the CPU cores it operates on.
Dependency expression between build jobs based on data rather than other jobs directly, offering more control over job execution and increasing performance.
Support for fork-join parallelism structures between jobs, allowing simultaneous job execution and enhancing speed.
Support for arbitrary groupings of job dependency chains for aggregating results and logs.
CoreFlow is deployed as a group of related services, each performing different roles. This group is known as an Environment. Users can access these services through various clients including:

Command Line Client: Connects to a single Environment during each invocation.
Web Client: Connects to and displays pages from a single Environment.
Desktop Client: Connects to multiple Environments simultaneously, managing connections through a tab-based interface.
Each Environment is reachable at a single URL, with various services available at different paths. This architecture is implemented using Envoy, a high-performance reverse proxy, for path-based routing.

CoreFlow is developed primarily in Rust to ensure system reliability and security. It consists of several libraries and executables, each executable being deployed inside a container with intercommunication across the network. Key components include:

The coreflow_protocol library, responsible for communication protocols and data structures.
The coreflow_executor executable, responsible for executing build jobs.
The coreflow_scheduler executable, managing job execution schedules.
The coreflow_data_manager executable, handling dependencies and artifact storage.
The coreflow_web_ui executable, which serves the web-based UI of CoreFlow.
The coreflow_cli executable, which serves as the command-line interface client for CoreFlow.
The architecture is depicted through Structurizr diagrams for better visual understanding. CoreFlow also supports a basic web page client developed using the Yew framework in Rust.

This context should provide a good starting point to continue any future discussions on the co-development of CoreFlow.
