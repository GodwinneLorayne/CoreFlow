# coreflow_lib_protocol

The `coreflow_lib_protocol` will serve as the foundation of CoreFlow, defining the communication protocols and the data structures that will be used across the various services of CoreFlow. Here is an overview of its architecture and the Rust packages that you might use:

1. **Communication Protocols**: Define how services will communicate with each other. You may choose to use a protocol like HTTP(S), or a more sophisticated message passing system like gRPC, which supports bi-directional streaming and can be a good choice for CI/CD systems like CoreFlow where real-time updates and server pushes are useful.

   * For HTTP(S), you can use libraries like `hyper` or `reqwest`.
   * For gRPC, you can use `tonic`, which supports async and is built on top of `hyper`.

2. **Data Serialization**: For encoding and decoding the data that's being sent and received, you will need a serialization format. JSON is a popular choice, but if you are looking for better performance, consider using something like Protocol Buffers or MessagePack.

   * For JSON, you can use `serde_json` along with `serde`, Rust's generic serialization/deserialization framework.
   * For Protocol Buffers, `prost` is a good choice, especially if you choose to use `tonic` for gRPC, as they are designed to work together.
   * For MessagePack, `rmp-serde` is a Rust MessagePack library that is compatible with `serde`.

3. **Data Structures**: Define Rust structs for all the types of data that will be sent and received across the network. This will include things like build jobs, dependencies, and results.

    The specific libraries will depend on what you need for your data structures, but a common one is `uuid` for generating universally unique identifiers.

4. **Error Handling**: Good error handling is crucial for a reliable system. You will need to define custom error types for the different types of errors that can occur. 

    For this, you can use the `thiserror` library, which allows you to derive the `Error` trait for your custom error types in a straightforward way.

5. **Asynchronous Programming**: Given the nature of network communication, it's likely that you'll need to use async programming. Rust's async ecosystem is built around the `tokio` runtime, which you will probably need to include.

Given these considerations, your `Cargo.toml` dependencies might look something like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
hyper = "0.14"
serde = "1.0"
serde_json = "1.0"
uuid = "0.8"
thiserror = "1.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
tonic = "0.5"
prost = "0.8"
```

The exact version numbers will depend on the current versions at the time of your project. The versions given above are as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.
