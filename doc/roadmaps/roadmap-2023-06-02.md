# Roadmap 2023-06-02

Developing a system like CoreFlow can be a complex endeavor. Breaking down the process into manageable stages can help 
structure the implementation and make it more manageable. Here's a suggested roadmap:

1. **Stage 1 - Architecture Design and Planning**:
   Define the architecture of the system, including all of the different components and how they interact. This stage also includes selecting the technology stack and planning the various stages of development.

2. **Stage 2 - Core Libraries and Services Development**:
   Start with the development of the core libraries and services, such as `coreflow_protocol` and `coreflow_data_manager`. These components are critical as they provide fundamental functionality that other components rely on.

3. **Stage 3 - Job Execution and Scheduling**:
   Develop the components related to job execution (`coreflow_executor`) and scheduling (`coreflow_scheduler`). Ensure proper testing and debugging in this stage to validate job handling mechanisms.

4. **Stage 4 - Client Interface Development**:
   Start building out the client interfaces for CoreFlow, including the command-line interface (`coreflow_cli`) and the web user interface (`coreflow_web_ui`). This involves not just functional development, but also considerations around user experience.

5. **Stage 5 - Integration of Envoy and Environment Configuration**:
   Implement the use of Envoy as a reverse proxy and set up the environment configuration. This includes mapping URLs to services and setting up load balancing.

6. **Stage 6 - Multi-Environment and Desktop Client Development**:
   Develop the mechanisms to support multiple environments and create the desktop client that can handle multiple environments simultaneously.

7. **Stage 7 - Testing and Validation**:
   Thoroughly test the system in various scenarios, validate its performance, reliability, and extensibility. This stage should also include security testing and vulnerability assessment.

8. **Stage 8 - Documentation and User Guides**:
   Develop comprehensive documentation and user guides for end-users and developers. Good documentation is essential for system adoption and maintenance.

9. **Stage 9 - Release and Maintenance**:
   Release the first version of CoreFlow, collect user feedback, and incorporate necessary changes in subsequent iterations. Continuous maintenance and upgrades are required to keep the system up-to-date and reliable.

Please note that while the stages are distinct, there might be overlap, and some tasks may need to run concurrently. This roadmap is flexible and should be adapted to the project's specific requirements and constraints.
