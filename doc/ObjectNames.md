Designing intuitive and memorable names for the data objects in CoreFlow will greatly enhance user experience and usability. The names should provide insight into what these objects represent and their role in the system. Here are a few examples:

1. **BuildArtifacts**: This object can hold the compiled binaries, libraries, or any other outputs from a build job. The term "artifact" is commonly used in the build process to refer to the output files, so this name is easy to understand.

2. **TestReports**: If a job involves running tests, it can output a TestReport object that includes the results of the test, such as pass/fail status, error messages, etc.

3. **DependencyManifest**: This can represent the set of dependencies required by a job. It could include things like external libraries, packages, or even other BuildArtifacts from previous jobs.

4. **JobMetrics**: This object could include performance metrics related to a job, like execution time, memory usage, CPU utilization, etc. This can be helpful for performance monitoring and optimization.

5. **DeploymentInstructions**: This object could hold information about how the output of a job should be deployed. For example, it could specify a target environment, configuration settings, etc.

6. **JobLogs**: This object can store logs generated during the execution of a job. It would provide useful information for debugging if something goes wrong.

7. **ValidationStatus**: If a job involves some sort of validation, like code linting or security vulnerability scanning, this object can hold the results of those checks.

8. **TaskParameters**: This could be a general-purpose object to hold parameters that control how a job behaves.

9. **EnvironmentConfig**: This could hold environment-specific information, such as environment variables, that might be necessary for a job to run.

Remember, it's important that the object names are not just memorable but also accurately represent their contents and purpose. You can certainly iterate on these names as you continue developing CoreFlow and receive feedback from its users.
