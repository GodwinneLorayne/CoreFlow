# CoreFlow

## 1. Overview

CoreFlow is a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) system with the primary focus on reliability, performance, and extensibility. This document outlines the architecture, design, and operational considerations for CoreFlow.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1. High-Level Architecture

CoreFlow is designed as a distributed system, leveraging a server scaling architecture that allows it to utilize all available CPU cores for job execution. The primary components of the system include the Client, Scheduler, Workers, and Storage.

### 2.2. Component Details

Client: Responsible for defining jobs, specifying job dependencies, and retrieving build results and logs.

Scheduler: Responsible for scheduling jobs based on defined dependencies and available system resources. It effectively handles fork-join parallelism and manages the assignment of tasks to the Workers.

Workers: Multiple worker instances run in parallel, each executing a single job at a time. They communicate with the scheduler and update it about job completion status and output.

Storage: Consists of two parts: The Database and the Filesystem. The Database stores job definitions, dependencies, and job statuses. The Filesystem stores build artifacts, logs, and output data.

## 3. Job Dependency Management

CoreFlow's unique approach of managing job dependencies is based on data. Jobs declare what data they will produce, and dependent jobs specify the data they require. This removes the need for explicit job-to-job dependencies and increases reliability.

## 4. Parallelism and Concurrency

CoreFlow uses a fork-join model for parallelism. This allows independent jobs to be executed in parallel, and their results can be joined for dependent jobs. The Scheduler is responsible for deciding when to fork and join jobs based on the data dependencies.

## 5. Extensibility

The extensible nature of CoreFlow allows for arbitrary groupings of job dependency chains, enabling efficient result and log aggregation. This gives users the power to define groups for better visualisation, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

## 6. Security

CoreFlow maintains a high standard of security with encrypted communications between components, and access control for users.

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

CoreFlow includes robust monitoring and logging features, helping users to identify bottlenecks or failures, and to monitor the health of the system.

## 8. Backup and Recovery

The system will have regular backups to ensure data durability. In case of any catastrophic failure, recovery procedures will be in place to restore the system with minimal data loss and downtime.

## 9. Conclusion

CoreFlow, with its unique approach to CI/CD, provides users with a reliable, performant, and extensible system that effectively scales across CPU cores. Its ability to express dependencies between jobs based on data, support fork-join parallelism, and facilitate arbitrary groupings of job dependency chains for result and log aggregation makes it a highly powerful and flexible tool for managing software build and deployment pipelines.

The proposed design considers key aspects such as scalability, reliability, extensibility, security, and monitoring, making CoreFlow a robust solution for CI/CD needs. Further enhancements and refinements are expected as we gather feedback and experiences from users.
