# JobQueues

JobQueues in CoreFlow form an integral part of the job scheduling and execution process, providing a staging area where jobs wait for their turn to be executed. They add a layer of control and flexibility to the system and serve several purposes:

1. **Job Scheduling**: At the most basic level, JobQueues help manage and schedule jobs. When a JobTrigger fires, the job is placed into a JobQueue, where it waits until resources are available for it to be executed.

2. **Job Prioritization**: JobQueues allow for job prioritization. If certain jobs are more critical than others, they can be moved up in the JobQueue so they get executed sooner. This is particularly useful in situations where resources are limited and not all jobs can be run simultaneously.

3. **Job Cancellation**: If a job no longer needs to be executed, it can be removed from the JobQueue before it starts running. This saves resources and prevents unnecessary work.

4. **Metadata Presentation**: Jobs in a JobQueue present metadata about their type, providing insight into the job's function without having to delve into its details. This can be helpful for users who are managing and monitoring the system.

5. **Scalability**: Each CoreFlow environment starts with a default JobQueue, but additional JobQueues can be added as needed. This provides scalability and flexibility, as different JobQueues can be used to manage different types of jobs or handle different priority levels. 

6. **Separation of Concerns**: By having JobTriggers place jobs into JobQueues rather than executing them directly, CoreFlow separates the concerns of job triggering and job execution. This allows for more flexible and robust system behavior. For example, if a system failure occurs during job execution, the corresponding JobTrigger is not directly affected and can continue to operate normally, placing new jobs into the JobQueue.

In summary, JobQueues in CoreFlow serve as flexible and effective tools for managing job execution. By controlling when and in what order jobs are run, JobQueues help ensure that resources are used effectively and that the most important tasks get priority. This leads to more efficient and reliable CI/CD processes.
