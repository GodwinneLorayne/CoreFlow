# Scalers

Scalers in CoreFlow fulfill an essential role in dynamically managing resources to match the demand for job execution. They provide the system with the capability to adapt to varying workload levels efficiently, from large-scale production environments to local development settings. Let's explore their key features and benefits in detail:

1. **Dynamic Resource Management**: The main function of a Scaler is to monitor JobQueues and dynamically adjust the number of Workers based on the current demand. By creating Workers when jobs pile up and terminating them when idle, Scalers ensure that resources are used efficiently and costs are controlled, especially in cloud-based or Kubernetes-backed environments.

2. **Hardware Agnostic**: Scalers are not bound to any specific hardware or platform. They can be integrated with different infrastructure providers, such as a Kubernetes cluster or public cloud providers like AWS, GCP, or Azure. This gives users the flexibility to choose the infrastructure that best suits their requirements and budget.

3. **Scalability**: As the name implies, Scalers are instrumental in achieving scalability in CoreFlow. As the number of jobs increases, Scalers ensure that the system can meet this demand by provisioning additional Workers. This allows CoreFlow to seamlessly handle workload spikes and grow with your needs.

4. **Local Testing and Development**: Aside from large-scale deployments, Scalers are also valuable for local testing and development. A Scaler could create Workers on a developer's workstation, allowing for easy testing and debugging of Jobs or even the CoreFlow system itself. This makes Scalers a valuable tool not just for running your CI/CD workflows, but also for developing and improving them.

5. **Complementing Schedulers**: Scalers work hand-in-hand with Schedulers. While Schedulers are responsible for assigning jobs to available Workers, Scalers ensure that there is an optimal number of Workers available in the first place. This synergy between Scalers and Schedulers is key to the smooth operation of the system.

In summary, Scalers in CoreFlow provide dynamic, scalable, and efficient resource management. They enable the system to adapt to varying workload levels, support multiple hardware platforms, and facilitate local testing and development, all while working in tandem with Schedulers to keep your CI/CD workflows running smoothly.
